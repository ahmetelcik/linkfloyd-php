## Frontend JS-CSS Dependencis

I'm currenty using Laravel's [Elixir](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/elixir) for combine scripts and stylesheets.

Elixir is really easy to use and understand. But since i'm not FE developer,
i'm open for your suggestions.

To compile scripts, simple run these commands:

    npm install -g bower gulp

    npm install # install package.json dependencies
    
    bower install # installs bower.json dependencies
    
    gulp #runs elixir for one time
    
    gulp watch #watches your js/css file changes as sync
